#AmazonClone

This is the first project that I have created since I started coding a few weeks back. All the knowledge of HTML & CSS that was used to build this was implemented via self-study. I studied the basics of web development from YouTube channels and built this project. 

#Overview

This project is a clone of "Amazon.com", I have tried to replicate as many details of that page as possible, which includes the search bar, the navigation options, the products, the footer, and many more! 


I have provided the HTML & CSS files for this project and all the other resources used in the website. 



#ThankYou
Since this is the first project that I have built and pushed on my Git Hub, I understand it might not be the most perfect clone. 
If you feel like contributing to it, feel free to do so. I am always open for new advice & suggestions.
